## Revenue Streams

### 1. LifeXP.io SaaS ($5-15/mo)

**Target**: People who tried the free prompts and want persistence without self-hosting.

| Tier | Price | MRR Goal (Y1) | Features |
|------|-------|---------------|----------|
| Free | $0 | N/A | 30-day history, 1 user, basic stats |
| Pro | $5/mo | $500 (100 users) | Unlimited history, API, integrations, widgets |
| Family | $15/mo | $750 (50 families) | 5 users, leaderboards, kid profiles, challenges |
| API | $0.001/log | $250 | Developers building on platform |

**Y1 MRR Target**: $1,500/mo = $18K ARR

### 2. Custom GPT Monetization

OpenAI's GPT revenue sharing (when available):
- Users interact with your GPT
- OpenAI shares usage revenue
- Estimate: $0.01-0.05 per conversation

**Projection**: 10K monthly users × $0.02 = $200/mo passive

### 3. GitHub Sponsors

Tiers:
- $5/mo: Name in README, Discord role
- $15/mo: Logo in README, priority support
- $50/mo: Custom activity types implemented

**Target**: $300/mo from sponsors

### 4. Affiliate/Partnerships

Partner with complementary products:

### 5. Enterprise/Teams (Future)

- $8/user/mo for organizations
